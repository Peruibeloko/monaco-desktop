# Monaco for Desktop

This project is a simple Tauri wrapper around Monaco, with the addition of file reading and writing.
For when you just want a nice editor, but you don't want a full blown VS Code.

Frontend is ~~unfortunately~~ built using React and the [@monaco-editor/react](https://github.com/suren-atoyan/monaco-react) package
